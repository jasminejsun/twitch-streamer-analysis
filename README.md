# twitch-streamer-analysis

## About
This mini-project is an analysis on the top 1000 twitch streamers from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata/data) for the course SC1015: Into to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

## Problem Definition
Can we predict the popularity of a Twitch streamer (measured by watch time) based on their streaming habits, and engagement metrics?

## Models Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regression

## What we learned
- Random Forest Regression from sklearn
- Collaborating using GitHub
- How to handle heavily skewed datasets

## Conclusion
- Yes, it is possible to predict the popularity of a Twitch streamer with good accuracy
- It is important to focus on factors like viewer engagement and streaming consistently as a top streamer.
- Watch time and average viewers are critical metrics to take in account
